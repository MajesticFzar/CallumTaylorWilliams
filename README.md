# 👋 Hi, I'm MajesticFzar

I’m passionate about open-source intelligence (OSINT), signal interception, and digital privacy — always curious about how systems work and how data flows.

## 🚀 What I'm Interested In

- 🛰️ OSINT, SIGINT, and real-time information gathering
- 📡 HAM radio, ADS-B flight tracking, and radio comms
- 💻 Self-hosting with Proxmox, Docker, and Linux
- 🔐 Data protection, takedown requests, and online reputation control
- 📚 Lifelong learning through hands-on experimentation

## 🛠️ What You'll Find Here

This GitHub is a place for me to:

- Document my self-hosted tools and server setup
- Share shell scripts, configs, and Docker setups
- Track my OSINT tools and data hygiene methods
- Explore signal analysis and technical curiosities
